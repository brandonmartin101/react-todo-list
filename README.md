This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

It uses React, Lodash, and Axios to handle a simple to-do list. The list view can be toggled to include/exclude active or completed tasks, and a batch edit is also available. Tasks are stored locally in a cookie, and there is no cloud storage of the to-do list. So don't use this to store tasks which need to last a long time. It also uses Antd's UI system for icons and basic styles.
